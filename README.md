I am a Computer Science Engineer student with a strong foundation in Java Full Stack development and DevOps. I have hands-on experience in building end-to-end web applications using Java, Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Hibernate, and Servlets for backend development, along with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js for frontend development.

I have worked with MySQL for database management and used Git and GitHub for version control. I also have practical knowledge of DevOps tools and practices, including Maven, Jenkins for CI/CD pipelines, Docker for containerization, and Linux for application deployment and server management.

I am eager to apply my technical skills in a real-world environment, contribute to scalable software solutions, and grow as a professional software developer.
